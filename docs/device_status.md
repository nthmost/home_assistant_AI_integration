## Issues to Fix

### Critical
1. **Tuya Integration Broken** - Tube Lamp and possibly the 3 Candelabra bulbs
   - Error: "sign invalid" from Tuya API
   - Needs reconfiguration in HA Settings → Devices & Services
   - See TUYA_FIX_GUIDE.md for details

### Important
2. **Three Smart Candelabra Bulbs unavailable** - Likely same Tuya issue as Tube Lamp
3. **Third Reality Motion Sensor** - Unavailable since July 2025 (check battery or reconnect)
4. **RPi Power status sensor** - Offline since January 2025

### Updates Available
Several add-ons and HA itself have updates available:
- Home Assistant Core Update (available)
- Home Assistant OS Update (available)
- Advanced SSH & Web Terminal (available)
- Duck DNS (available)
- Matter Server (available)
- Mosquitto broker (available)
- Spotify Connect (available)

## Devices You Might Want to Add

Based on your current setup, consider adding:
1. **More motion sensors** - You only have one (broken) motion sensor
2. **Temperature/humidity sensors** - None currently detected
3. **Door/window sensors** - None currently detected
4. **Smart plugs** - You have one power strip, might want more
5. **Cameras** - No cameras detected (but camera service is available)
6. **Climate control** - No thermostats detected

## Next Steps

1. Fix Tuya integration to restore Tube Lamp and Candelabra bulbs
2. Check/replace battery on Third Reality Motion Sensor
3. Investigate RPi Power status sensor
4. Consider what new devices to add
5. Apply available updates
